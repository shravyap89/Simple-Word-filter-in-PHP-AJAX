# wordfilterphp
Web based word filter implemented with AJAX and PHP

Here are the implementation details. I have kept the design of website fairly simply focusing only on the functionality. The three test cases which I considered where as follows:

1.	When an exact match exists in the wordlist eg. maverick
2.	When word in word list is present with some other word not in the list example: maverickhello
3.	When word in word list is present with some other word not in the list example: maverickranger

These three test cases suffice the requirements mentioned in description.
